			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>Henry B. Schaffner Elementary opened in November 1955. Mr. Schaffner served many years on the County Board of Education; 20 years as a member of the Board and president of the Protestant Orphans home. An addition was added in 1959. The school is one floor "L" shaped that sits on 10 acres. The school closed in 1980 due to declining enrollment. While vacant it was damaged by a fire and vanalized. It reopened in 1988. At that time it served 900 students. They were all kindergartens in two 1/2 day sesions. Schaffner now houses over 600 students in the primary levels through the fifth grade. Schaffner is looking forward to a new Media Center at the end of the school year 2014-2015.</p>
